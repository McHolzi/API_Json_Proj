# API_Json_Proj

Just a few small projects to learn how to use APIs 

Will hopefully get more interesting over time 

Trying to write a program that makes it easier to schedule work and other events by comparing the events in my google calendar with the possible working days in a google sheets file (or more then one) provided by the client.
